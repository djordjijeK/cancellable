## Cancellable

This mini-project provides a mechanism for running cancellable tasks in Rust. It allows you to execute tasks that can be stopped externally, offering greater control over long-running operations. The implementation is essentially cloned from [jonhoo/minion](https://github.com/jonhoo/minion/tree/master) for educational purposes.
